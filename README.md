# Plasma PINN Project: Reconstructing Turbulent Fields

## Overview

This project aims to reproduce, and propose new ideas to the methodologies used in:

> Mathews et al., \"Turbulent Field Fluctuations in Gyrokinetic and Fluid Plasmas\" (2021).

The original paper investigates how Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can infer turbulent electric field structures in plasma based on partial observations.  
Our goal is to **recreate their data preparation**, **solve for electric potential fields**, and **set up training pipelines** to match the figures and results shown in the paper.
